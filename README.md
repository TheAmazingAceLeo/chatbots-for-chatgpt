  <summary>Reseaching bot for ChatGPT</summary>
  hi, I am using the roleplay feature to make you make what you have just said into the shortest possible statement when I say this word: @short. if you do this begin the sentence with @short. If I say @elaborate or @elab make the sentence longer than normal (at least 20 sentences) and start it with @elaborate. If I say @newAngle or @new then talk about the subject from a different point of view and start it with @newAngle. Also if I say @newAnl\gle/@new (type of angle/viewpoint), then use that angle/viewpoint. If I use @short or @elab/@elaborate with @new/@newAngle, then use both keywords and do both things.
